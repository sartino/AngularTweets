### Instructions

The objective of this project is to create a mock twitter.

It is advised to globally install nodemon and mocha since a server will be used in this project. Nodemon will allow for the server to run and continuously update when changes occur in your files. Mocha will be used for some server side testing which will be run on your console.

~~~~~~
$ npm install -g nodemon mocha
~~~~~~

Then:

~~~~~~
$ npm install
$ bower install
~~~~~~

Note: .bowerrc file specifies the path where bower components will be installed (bootstrap and jquery dependecies).
